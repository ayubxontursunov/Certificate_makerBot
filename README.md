6. Find `@Certificate_makerBot` on telegram and start the bot
7. Send your input data one by one on telegram (e.g., name, course, mark, etc.)
8. Get your certificate on telegram!

The bot will then generate certificates based on the provided data and save them in the specified output directory.

## Customization

To use the bot, follow these steps:

2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ayubxontursunov/certificate_create_bot.git
   cd certificate_create_bot
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the bot by running main_bot.py
5. Find `@Certificate_makerBot` on telegram and start the bot
6. Send your input data one by one on telegram (e.g., name, course, mark, etc.)
7. Get your certificate on telegram!

The bot will then generate certificates based on the provided data and save them in the specified output directory.

## Customization

You can customize the design and layout of the certificates by modifying the template files in the `media` directory. Feel free to adjust the fonts, colors, logos, and any other elements to match your preferences.
